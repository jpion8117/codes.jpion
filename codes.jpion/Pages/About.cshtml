        <h1>About Me:</h1>

        <h2>Where it Began</h2>
        <p>After graduating high school, I found myself drawn to computers and video games, 
            which led me to explore the world of programming. In 2011, I picked up a book 
            that taught C++ through game design principles, and I was hooked. I spent the 
            next several years mastering C++, building small games, and honing my skills 
            in object-oriented programming. My early experience with game loops, inheritance, 
            and polymorphism fueled my interest in creating clean, reusable code.</p>

        <p>As I advanced from retail worker to management, my passion for coding remained 
            strong, though time to code became scarce. However, in 2020, I had an opportunity 
            to apply my coding skills at work. Using Google Apps Script, I developed a 
            system to track bottle returns, which gave me the push I needed to begin working 
            toward a career in software development.</p>

        <h2>Building Passion and Skills</h2>
        <p>The following spring, I enrolled at Northwestern Michigan College, balancing my 
            full-time job in retail with my studies. Despite the challenges, I maintained a 
            3.8 GPA, was inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and received an 
            award at the 2024 Honors and Leadership Convocation.</p>

        <p>In addition to excelling in my own academic career, I quickly took an interest 
            in helping my peers succeed. I encouraged others to step out of their comfort 
            zone and helped guide them to success. My efforts didn’t go unnoticed—eventually, 
            my instructors noticed my commitment and invited me to take a formal role as a 
            tutor for the CIT department my final year. This experience deepened my own knowledge 
            of software development fundamentals. More importantly, it allowed me to contribute 
            to making the world of software development a more accessible and welcoming place 
            for anyone pursuing this exciting and ever-changing field.</p>

        <h2>The Next Chapter</h2>
        <p>Today, I’m eager to continue building on my diverse experience—whether it's designing 
            game engines or solving real-world problems with code—and I'm always looking for 
            opportunities to grow as a developer. Whether I’m working as part of a development 
            team or building custom solutions for a client, years of customer service have taught 
            me to meet the needs of those I’m working for first! It’s this blend of customer service 
            and development experience that truly makes me the “you” developer. You dream it, I 
            build it!</p>
